Notes to keep on how well using the stack goes.

following steps to test git-lfs install, I keep getting:
Username for 'https://s3.amazonaws.com':
Password for 'https://s3.amazonaws.com':

I can just hit enter and it works, but what a pain in the ass


updating my credential helper from osxkeychain
used command:
git config --global credential.helper /usr/share/doc/git/contrib/credential/libsecret/git-credential-libsecret

nope, that didn't work

try setting batch=true in the ~/.gitconfig
nope, that didn't do anything

looks like adding:
[credential "https://s3.amazonaws.com"]
    helper = store

did the trick. Mother fuck, what a pain.

> put in PR to update doc

(ok, forgot to setup and that was a pain. )

OK. Ran through the Part 1 and set up my butler. in: /Users/yoachim/Scratch/Stack_Learn
